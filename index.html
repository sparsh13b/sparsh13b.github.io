    <h1>ALL ABOUT MY BASKETBALL.</h1>

    <h2 id="Special-game"> This game has a special place in my heart </h2>


    
    <p class="history-of-basketball"> My three years were committed to this game before starting a complete different process</p>
    
    
    <h2>Basic info.</h2>
    <p class="history-of-basketball">There was a  professer in a university in United States of America who once was training his students for their shooting practice by using one ball and a bucket that's it, yes the idea striked to him. Although this game was invented in the US but it rapidly widespread to other nations and continents around the world. Today after US , France has the most solid National Men's Basketball team which competes in the FIBA.</p>
     

    <h2>The motto of this website is to show my love for this game .</h2>
    <p id="Initial-starting">I first started playing Basketball when I was around <em>13</em> years old, <strong>switching from cricket to an unknown game wasn't so <em>easy</em></strong> <br> 
         after 1 year ,i realised that this is the game which I will stick to .I always wondered and still am wondering how players jump so high and put the ball in basket through a rigorous process called DUNK<br>
 
 
 
            <h3>Why Basketball is a good game ?</h3>

    <ul>
    
        <li>Because they make body open to chase and run</li>
        <li> It requires fast reflex and fast decisioning</li>
        <li>It also makes the player's muscles tight and strong</li>
    </ul>


    <h4> Why are most good and well known  Basketball players from US only </h4>

    <p class="history-of-basketball"> Beacause US had great and greatest facilities for Basketball.<br> 
         Younger kids in US start playing basketball very early as compared to the rest of the world<br>
         Kids tend to make Basketball as their potential career because of the oppurtunities and the success in future.</p>
